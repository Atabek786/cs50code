                <p>Photo was took in the summer holiday during Eid-Al-Adha in Erdek. Pretty chill city, a lot of beaches. Most of my time there I spent with my family. Also I prayed eid prayer there. The mosque was full and although I didn't understand the khutba (because I don't know turkish) it didn't bother me at all. I find peace at mosques.</p>
