                <p>Usually my day contains praying, coding, going to the gym and spending time with my family. I am learning how to code on my own and I feel like a little child in the jungle. There's so much to learn...</p>
                <p>P.S. The mosque in the photo is the nearest mosque from my home. In Turkey there are mosques everywhere mashaAllah.</p>

                <p>Photo was took in the summer holiday during Eid-Al-Adha in Erdek. Pretty chill city, a lot of beaches. Most of my time there I spent with my family. Also I prayed eid prayer there. The mosque was full and although I didn't understand the khutba (because I don't know turkish) it didn't bother me at all. I find peace at mosques.</p>
