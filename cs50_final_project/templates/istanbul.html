            Throughout history, Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, has served as the capital of three great empires: the Roman, Byzantine. But none of them resisted against the power of muslims. Mehmed the Conqueror made his life mission to take Constantinople and he did it in the age of 21. He continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. At the same time he was merciful towards the people of other religions. 

            „I declare to the whole world, the Bosnians are under protection. No one can disturb these people nor their churches, nor harm them. Nobody in the world will touch these people and not harm them.“

            In general, he was a very cool guy and had a huge impact of the whole world.

            Despite Turkey's rich Islamic history, today almost half of the youth is either atheists or believe in false gods or beliefs. Why did that happen? Well, there is combination of factors.

            First factor, Turkey's history of secularism and the legacy of Kemal Atatürk. The secularization efforts initiated by Atatürk aimed to create a more modern and Westernized Turkey. As a result, religious practices were de-emphasized in public life and education. This secular environment may have contributed to a generation of young people who are less religiously inclined.

        <p class="pharashome2">Second, because of the globalization of the world. Nowadays main stream media is controlled by westerns unfortunately and surely reminding people their meaning of life is not what they want.
